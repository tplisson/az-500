### Security Principals  
2 main types of principals:
- **User Principal** representing people 
  - Guests
  - Cloud-Only users
  - Directory-Synced Users
- **Service Principal** representing an Application or Service
- **Device principal** (not the focus of this exam)  


### Users
Types of Users:
- Internal member  
- Internal guest  
- External member  
- External guest  
  

### Groups 
- Used to manage security principals at scale   
- Both Azure Entra ID and AD DS groups can co-exist in your tenant  

2 types of Groups:  
- [x] **Security Groups**:  
  - Users  
  - Services Principals  
  - nested Security Groups  
- [x] **MS 365 Groups** (for MS365 collaboration)
  - Users (only)

### Dynamic Groups 
Group membership **based on properties**  
Using Membership **rules**
Group owners cannot modify group memberships  
Only Group Admins can manage dynamic membership 
Only users can be a member of a security group with the dynamic user membership type  

***Limitations***:
- Entra ID P1 license required  
- Service Principals cannot be members  
- MS365 Dynamic Groups cannot contain devices  
- Cannot mix membership, either:  
  - Dynamic User  
  or  
  - Dynamic Device  
- Deleted MS365 Groups are retained for 30 days  
- Deleted Security Groups are NOT retained  

### Service Principals
For applications only
- **App Registration** --> Service Principal --> Roles & Permissions
  - MS does NOT manage the credentials 
  - Bt default, any member user can register an application they own
- **Managed Identity** 
  - another Azure or on-prem resource
  - MS manages the credentials 
  - System-Assigned: only 1 single Azure resource
  - User-Assigned: many to many resources

Authentication:
- Password-based  
- Certificate-based 

Roles:
- Application Developper = your app
- Cloud Application Administrator = ALL apps ! 
- Application Administrator = Application Proxy  


### MS Entra External ID  

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/media/external-identities-overview/external-identities-overview.png" alt="MS Entra External ID Overview"/>  

- [x] B2B Business to Business  
- [x] B2C Business to Consumer  

B2B Collaboration 
- Partner using own identity solution  
- Enabled by default
- No need to manage external accounts & passwords  
- No need to sync accounts
- Self-service sign-up cannot be used with MS apps 

B2C Collaboration  
- Any SAML IdP  
- B2C Members are created in a separate dedicated B2C tenant  
- External identities licenses are shared with B2B users  
- B2C users cannot be useed to access MS resources secured by your Entra ID tenant  

### Exam tips:

**Azure AD Premium P1** is required to use:
- [x] Azure AD Application Proxy
- [x] Dynamic Groups
- [x] Password Writeback
- [x] Conditional Access 
- [x] Password Protection

**Azure AD Premium P2** is required to use:
- [x] Identity Protection
- [x] Access Reviews
- [x] Just-in-Time Access Management
